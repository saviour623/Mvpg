  * @NoEmptyFormatStr: Format is first checked to be non-empty
  * @CopyFormatToFc:
  *
  *             Then it is splitted into indices 0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31 (these indices
  *             corresponds to the value of @mask when rshfed by 1) of format checker (fc)
  * @GetFormatInExpectedOrder:
  *
  *             The format checker buffer, is checked
  * @CheckIgnoredSPecOrFormat:
  *
  *             Check if No format specifier is ignored (invalid at position) and there
  *             are no left over characters after format chars
  * @ErrorCheck:
  *
               The mask is checked for the following errors:
               (1). ’s’ is specified with any other specifiers (width);
               (2). ’f’ is specified with an ’x’ (hexedecimal float is unsupported);
               (3). There is no Type specifier;
               (4). Ignored mask value due to invalid positioning of specifiers or extra
		    * characters in format. usually if format is correct, a right shift of
		    * @mask by the total length of the specifier string (max: 6) should be
		    * non-zero, else otherwise.
  *
  *Note* There is no significant speedup attributed to this approach, it is just chosen to minimize the use of multiple swtich and if statements for checkks.
